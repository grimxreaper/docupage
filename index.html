                    The FIRST ORDER reigns.
                    Having decimated the peaceful
                    Republic, Supreme Leader Snoke
                    now deploys his merciless
                    legions to seize military
                    control of the galaxy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Only General Leia Organa's
                    band of RESISTANCE fighters
                    stand against the rising
                    tyranny, certain that Jedi
                    Master Luke Skywalker will
                    return and restore a spark of
                    hope to the fight.

                    But the Resistance has been
                    exposed. As the First Order
                    speeds toward the Rebel base,
                    the brave heroes mount a
                    desperate escape....

                        Following their successful operation to destroy Starkiller Base, <code>Resistance</code> fighters evacuate their main base on the planet D'Qar onto their fleet. Before they can complete their evacuation, First Order starships under General Armitage Hux arrive. Seeking to destroy the Resistance, Hux orders Captain Moden Canady to destroy the Resistance fleet and base with his Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix.

                        With the Dreadnought's cannon's knocked out, <code>Resistance</code> bombers advanced on the Fulminatrix. Despite having starfighter escorts led by Blue Leader Tallissan Lintra, several of the slow moving bombers are destroyed by TIE fighters. Captain Canady orders that the dreadnought's auto cannons be recharged so that they can target the Resistance cruisers. Several Resistance bombers are destroyed by a colliding TIE fighter, leaving Paige Tico's Cobalt Hammer as the last remaining bomber.

                    Having arrived on the water world of Ahch-To with the Wookiee Chewbacca and astromech droid R2-D2 aboard the Millennium Falcon, the Force-sensitive Rey meets Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. She hands him Skywalker's lightsaber but he tosses it over his shoulder and walks away. A puzzled Rey follows Luke into his hut in the nearby Jedi village.

                    Kylo Ren exits a turbolift and enter Supreme Leader Snoke's throne room aboard the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy. Snoke commends Hux for his plan and sends him to the bridge to oversee the pursuit of the Resistance. After Hux leaves, Snoke recalls seeing in Ren the potential to become a new Darth Vader, but now doubts his apprentice's resolve to fully embrace the dark side of the Force.

                    He orders Ren to remove his helmet, and upon seeing his scarred face—the result of his loss to Rey on Starkiller Base—he states that Ren has too much of Han's heart in him. Ren protests, claiming he embraced the dark side by killing Han, but Snoke furiously retorts that Ren instead psychologically weakened himself in committing the murder, causing him to be defeated by Rey, a junk scavenger who had previously never even wielded a lightsaber.

                <p>
                    Ren reacts angrily to the insult, but Snoke repulses him with Force lightning and dismisses him as just "a child in a mask." Enraged, Ren destroys his helmet by violently smashing it to pieces against the walls of an elevator, before setting out in his personal TIE silencer to attack the Resistance fleet.
