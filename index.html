                    The FIRST ORDER reigns.
                    Having decimated the peaceful
                    Republic, Supreme Leader Snoke
                    now deploys his merciless
                    legions to seize military
                    control of the galaxy.

                    Only General Leia Organa's
                    band of RESISTANCE fighters
                    stand against the rising
                    tyranny, certain that Jedi
                    Master Luke Skywalker will
                    return and restore a spark of
                    hope to the fight.

                    But the Resistance has been
                    exposed. As the First Order
                    speeds toward the Rebel base,
                    the brave heroes mount a
                    desperate escape....

                        Following their successful operation to destroy Starkiller Base, Resistance fighters evacuate their main base on the planet D'Qar onto their fleet. Before they can complete their evacuation, First Order starships under General Armitage Hux arrive. Seeking to destroy the Resistance, Hux orders Captain Moden Canady to destroy the Resistance fleet and base with his Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix.

                        With the Dreadnought's cannon's knocked out, Resistance bombers advanced on the Fulminatrix. Despite having starfighter escorts led by Blue Leader Tallissan Lintra, several of the slow moving bombers are destroyed by TIE fighters. Captain Canady orders that the dreadnought's auto cannons be recharged so that they can target the Resistance cruisers. Several Resistance bombers are destroyed by a colliding TIE fighter, leaving Paige Tico's Cobalt Hammer as the last remaining bomber.
